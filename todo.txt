# To-do
* PyPSD:
    1. Take bin limits AND bin average into account, see Merkus book and hariba
       website below.
    2. Look into "critical pressure" program I did for Lili for simpler way to
       solve linear equations.
    3. Optimize and reduce the program, use dictionaries, etc. consider how best
       to deliver the results, and if plotting is still worth it.

# Several ideas
1. Make a full blown package from PyPSD, including particle analysis. Check
   other packages and compare functionality. If viable, this can be published in
   both JOSS and JORS.
2. Create an in-depth method for doing particle analysis studies geared towards
   microalgae. Using two sets of distinct microalgae at two different stages
   (whole and disrupted), plus a model emulsion dataset (5 datasets total) would
   be ideal. The different series can also be analyzed in the granulometer, and
   also by hand counting/measuring, yielding a very well characterized reference
   set. This could be published in a journal concerning computer data analysis,
   citing the above references.
